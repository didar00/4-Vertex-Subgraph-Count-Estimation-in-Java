# 4-Vertex-Subgraph-Count-Estimation-in-Java

Sampler algorithm which is implemented in UndirectedGraph class's sampler method selects a set of edges from a undirected simple graph with given probabilities
so that this edges could be used to estimate the count of different motifs that is indicated in the research paper "Path Sampling: A Fast and Provable Method for Estimating
4-Vertex Subgraph Counts". This java program's purpose is to provide a more restricted selection way to improve the sampler algorithm.
